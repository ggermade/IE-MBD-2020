# Forecasting Time Series: Tools
This class was heavily based on R and RStudio, with some reliance on Excel.

# Forecasting Time Series Visual Guide
I created a Visual Guide in Excel to assist my dear teammates in better understanding the theory behind different concepts of Time Series decomposition analysis, necessary for being able to apply ARIMA-based models.

# Assignment 1: Time Series Classifications
Further, I included the first assignment which had us plot and classify distinct time series in R, within several thresholds including Nonstationarity, WN, SWN or GW, as well as determining whether a linear or nonlinear model is necessary for prediction.

# Group Project: Coca-Cola Sales Predictions
Finally, I included the final group assignment which had us predict sales of Coca-Cola using a SARIMA (Season Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Forecast, as well as the group report. Project coded in R.
